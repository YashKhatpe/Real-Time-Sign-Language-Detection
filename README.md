# Sign2Text - ML powered Sign Language Interpreter

**Sign2Text** is an ML-powered system that translates sign language gestures into real-time text, enabling better communication for the deaf and mute community. Using the Inception Inflated 3D (I3D) model and natural language processing, it accurately recognizes gestures and generates context-aware sentences. Tailored for healthcare settings, Sign2Text bridges communication gaps in critical environments, with plans for further enhancements and integration with virtual platforms.
## Appendix

**Sign2Text** leverages advanced machine learning models and datasets to create a real-time sign language translation system. The core model, based on the Inception Inflated 3D (I3D) Convolutional Network, effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of sign language gestures. The integration of the Gemini API enhances the systemâ€™s ability to generate grammatically correct and contextually relevant sentences. 

- **Dataset**: The WLASL dataset, containing over 2000 sign language words, was used to train the model. The dataset was further customized for healthcare-related terminologies to cater to real-world applications in hospitals and emergency settings.

- **Technologies**: 
  - Inception Inflated 3D (I3D) Convolutional Network
  - Gemini API for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - MediaPipe for landmark detection
  - LSTM-based sequence modeling for gesture recognition
  - WLASL dataset for sign language vocabulary

- **Future Plans**: 
  - Expansion of the gesture library
  - Enhancements for low-light and occluded condition performance
  - Integration with virtual communication platforms like Zoom and Google Meet

This system aims to be a comprehensive communication aid and educational tool for the deaf and mute community, making communication more accessible and inclusive.
